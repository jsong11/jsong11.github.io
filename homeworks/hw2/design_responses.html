						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that padding can be considered like white space in digital design. The example showing spacing by multiples of 8 was also helpful to understanding the importance of padding, which I can take into consideration in the future. White space also help with increasing readibility by dividing content into sections.

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is how common misunderstandings of the use of white space are given and then rebutted. I also enjoyed the examples which illustrates the importance of white space very clear visually. Lastly, I like that some psychological reasoning behind each design decision are also explained.

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> More spacing is generally better, but too much could potentially make lines of copy feel disconnected. Itâ€™s all about finding the right balance. </p>
