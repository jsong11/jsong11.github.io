                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned various visual techniques to make browsing a page more interesting. I learned that real world physical properties such as gravity can ba brought into the automations to make the interaction feel realistic. For example, the bouncing of the Add to Cart Interaction by Dannniel for Norde makes the user feel like they are stretching on a physical thing. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article was that there're no text to explain. What I take away from this article is whatever I observe from the user interaction animations. It is a very straight forward way of showing the power of interface and interactive design.

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite example was the Create a new message animation by Gr√©goire Vella. This animation shows the interface design of an all-in-one messaging syste. The user doesn't need to move their mouse at all when messaging someone. This is a very different approach than what I usually see in common messaging apps or functions. </p>
