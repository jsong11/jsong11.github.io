            <li> Design is something that can be learned. Anyone can develop a good eye for design through learning from other good designs. </li>
            <li> I like the observations and the author's explanations on how simple changes in design can make a large difference for the user experience. For example, using a specific city name instead of a generic action phrase to add excitement. </li>
            <li> "You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product." </li>
