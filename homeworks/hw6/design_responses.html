						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article is that our brains can recognize the speed of the changes without us conciously thinking
								about it. The speed of animation is important in this way that the audience should feel comfortable with the experience of the change. 
							I also learned that screen size also has an affect on the animation speed. 
							This is something I've never realized before because the animations on my devices has always felt natural to me.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article is the section about easing. The visual aids are very clear in showing that the animations look much more natural
								with easing. I think it is interesting where physical properties such as gravitional acceleration can be used to mimic the affect digitally. It is also 
								interesting how asymmetry is theh key to creating more natural animations.
